### Abstract (<250wds)
Genetic diversity circulates in populations in multiple forms; from single nucleotide variants to genome duplications.  Population genetic studies frequently emphasize single nucleotide variants, small indels (≤50bp) occasionally, but typically neglect large structural variants (>50bp), despite the fact that structural variants impact disproportionately large portions of the genome and may have a large impact on phenotype.  Here, we examined large structural variants circulating in five lab populations of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni by generating long-read sequences from pools of worms (~100 per population).  Using this method, we were able identify and genotype 17,446 SVs, representing 6.5% of the genome despite challenges in identifying low frequency variants. More than half (59%) of the SVs were shared between ≥4 populations, but 12% were found in only one of the five populations.  Within this subset, we identified 168 population-specific SVs that were at-or-near fixation in one population but missing (<5%) in the other four populations, and 5 of these variants directly impacted the coding sequence of 6 genes. We also identified 8 structural variants with extreme allele frequency differences between populations in genome regions associated with pathogen phenotypes. These results demonstrate that long-read sequence data from pooled individuals is a viable method to quickly catalogue structural variants circulating within populations and that some of these variants may be responsible for, or linked to regions experiencing, population-specific directional selection. 

### Significance Statement (<150wds)
Structural variants (SVs) are large genomic variants that are overlooked despite being the largest source of genetic variation within a population. This results from the difficulties and costs associated with identifying SVs at a population level.  This study attempts to solve these problems by using pooled samples and long-read sequencing to survey SVs circulating in five laboratory populations of the human parasite, Schistosoma mansoni. We were able to identify 17,446 SVs that impact 6.5% of the genome. A number of these SVs may be potentially driving, or linked to, population-specific adaptations. We also found 8 variants that were associated with known parasitic traits from previous studies.  This work highlights the value of long-read sequencing of pooled samples to document genetic diversity and provides a new method for exploring the role of SVs in parasite evolution and pathogenicity.
